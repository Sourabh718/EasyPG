        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-justify">
          EasyPG is not just a platform but also the result of an academic project that integrates 
          advanced <span class="font-semibold">Express.js</span> features, database connectivity, 
          and practical web development skills. Through this project, we explored real-world challenges 
          of building scalable applications, applying concepts like error handling, session management, 
          and CRUD operations. It reflects how academic learning can be transformed into solutions 
          with real-world utility.

        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-justify">
          We envision EasyPG as more than a projectâ€”our goal is to make it a trusted platform for 
          accommodation seekers. By continuously improving usability, expanding listings, and adding 
          secure communication between hosts and tenants, EasyPG aims to be the one-stop solution 
          for rental housing in the digital age.
